# DAoC-Char-Builder

Console application to attempt to find an ideal combination of items for a character in Dark Age of Camelot MMORPG.
Initially everything is hard coded except for the item database which is read from a JSON file from Broadsword (Mythic).
Not all of the metadata is provided, so some things like "material" are left out.
